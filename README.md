# ruby-music-shuffler
Your device does not have a shuffle mode? This script will randomly order the songs in a folder in a clean way.

## What it can do
![](https://i.imgur.com/dcDMN6J.png)
1. Shuffle (assigns a random order number from the total number of songs in the folder)
2. Reshuffle (same as Shuffle but first removes any previously assigned order numbers)
3. Unshuffle (removes any previously assigned order numbers)
4. Export playlist (exports song names to `Playlist.txt` in the same folder

Note: it supports only `.mp3` and `.wav` files

## How to use
1. Have `ruby` installed
2. Place `shuffler.rb` in the folder with the songs
3. Run `ruby path_to_folder/shuffler.rb` in console
4. Type the number of the operation and press `ENTER`
